      <h1>Epicodus Portfolio for Holly Wilkalis</h1>

      <h2>Because sometimes you just have to take a chance </h2>

      <p>There were a lot of life changes in 2017. After a pretty rough start to the year due to some family issues, things were looking up. I was working as a Web Content Migration Analyst for the state of Oregon, and I loved fixing years worth of bad web content and improving the website for both our visitors and our staff editors. This was only a temporary position, an intra-agency developmental rotation, and I was soon going to have to go back to my regular position, which I felt like I'd outgrown. But then thanks to a friend's referral, I was offered the chance to make the switch from life as a government employee to a marketing job in the private sector in May 2017.</p>

      <p>I'll spare you the details, but the moral of the story is that sometimes you just don't know if something is right for you until you try it. In this case, it just wasn't.</p>

      <p>After a challenging few months, I was ready to admit that the job wasn't the right fit for 2017 me. Right around that time, I learned that an old co-worker had signed up for an intensive coding program at Epicodus. I remembered that I'd looked at it myself earlier in the year when I was still working on the web migration project, and I suddenly realized that I now did have the money, and the time to make that leap. I read a lot of reviews, talked to some female friends working in various technical roles, and filled out an application.</p>

      <p>And that's how I landed here, making a major career change. I'm excited to embark on this new phase. If you'd like to know more about me educational and professional background, please go ahead and check out my About Me or Activities pages. (Warning: cat pictures ahead.) If you want to see some of the projects I've been working on, you'll find those on the Project Portfolio page.</p>
