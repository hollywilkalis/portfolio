        <p class="description">In 2007, I began volunteering with the city of Portland's Community Gardens as a project leader. With only a small staff and 50+ gardens to maintain, they need all the help they can get!</p>
        <p class="description">I coordinated work crews to help with a variety of projects ranging from site cleanup to invasive species removal to garden construction. My favorite part is when I get a call afterwards from a volunteer telling me that they enjoyed it so much that they now have their own garden plot!</p>

        <p class="description">Built in 1926, the Hollywood is one of Portland's longest-running movie theaters and a cultural and architectural treasure. Believe it or not, it's a 501(c)3 nonprofit too! Volunteers help out with special events and educational programming as well as selling tickets and concessions. This helps them keep their staffing costs down so they can put more resources into preserving the building and supporting film preservation and educational programming. I used to train new volunteers - these days I mostly just pop in for shifts occasionally where I pour beers, sneak handfuls of popcorn, and talk about movies.</p>

        <p class="description">(Unofficial slogan: "Unattended children will be given a box of doughnuts and an out of tune banjo.") The Gathering was started by the late Bill Martin as a way of preserving this old (but not forgotten) style of music and dance. I'm on the organizing committee, serving as the volunteer coordinator and box office manager. We work year-round to put on an annual event each MLK Day weekend. It brings together a few hundred people each year for a variety of classes, dances, concerts, jam sessions and musical fellowship.</p>

      <p class="description">In January 2014, I started training with LRSD. I began performing with them on cymbals that summer, and am now cross-training on a tenor drum. Sometimes we get to travel to events like the San Francisco Pride Parade or Bumbershoot, but mostly we play at events around the Portland metro area. If you're a runner you may have heard us at the start of the Portland marathon.</p>
